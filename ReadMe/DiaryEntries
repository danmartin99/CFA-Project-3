Software Development Diploma Final Project #3 Diary


Diary entry made 11:12am Mon 29 May 2017

On Thursday afternoon on the 25th May 2017, I visited Steve Nicole at the Tramsheds Chambers Cellars in Forest Lodge.

Steve and I discussed for 15 minutes what a hypothetical project might look like for my final project towards a Diploma in Software Development.

We discussed that there would be no deliverables to Chambers Cellars but that the project would be on available on line to down load if desired (on Github).

Steve indicated that they do already have a stock management system integrated with the POS (point of sale) system and he demonstrated this briefly to me.

We broadly agreed that for the purpose of my project that we might look to emulate the base funtionality of the existing stock control system.

A Project Charter is being created to capture the scope and requirements. In addition a Trello board has been created to capture the users stories and other requirements from Coder Factory Academy(CFA).

From the Trello Board and the Scrum add in the estimate is that 36 Story Point would be the effort required to complete this project. One person week is approximately 20 story points. We expect that approximately 2 weeks will be required to complete this project. 

Previous experience suggests that the all in cost per story point is $588.25. This equates to an all up cost of $21,177 for this project.

New Diary entry 9:57 Thu 8 Jun 2017

Over the past week, looked to connect with Steve Nicoll from Chambers Cellars at Tramsheds, after a number of attempts agreed with Jamie that he would take on the role of Project Sponsor. Showed Jamie yesterday the project and progress to date and that we had achieved getting Authentication working, that the main index page displayed the stock input screen and that it also displayed all the stock items. Links were available on all stock to allow for Edit, Delete, Sell, Receive and Stocktake. Other than Delete, each option linked to a seperate view that allowed the selected action to be performed.

Currently doing final activities to push the App to Heroku, finalise the Trello page, prepare the presentation and update the ReadMe file.
